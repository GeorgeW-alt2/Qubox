Establish a temporal sensor for an algorithmic time-based random number and an deterministic random number as an if condition checking the existence of such to the observation of a moving laser; therefore forcing the suitable ANDing/ORing system into a chronological state and the depth of a latent temporal buffer as a repeating single variable under certain qualifications is detectable retro-causality. It is super deterministic. Macro scale implementation introduces paradoxes...
